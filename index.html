                <h2><span class="heading">About me</span></h2>
                <h6>I'm a Digital Project Manager based in Leicester, UK.</h6>
                <p>The one thing I’m more passionate about than anything else in my work is helping teams to achieve more of what’s really important - I aim to bring clarity, motivation, structure and focus so that people understand the team’s common goals and work better together to achieve them.</p>
                <p>I have nearly a decade’s worth of experience in web projects and in that time I’ve seen the things that do and don’t work at every stage of the project lifecycle that can help or hinder its success.</p>
                <p>I’d love to talk to you if you’ve got a web / software project and you’re looking for a Project Manager to help make the project a success.</p>

                <h2><span class="heading">Background</span></h2>
                <p>Despite starting out going to cookery school and putting in some long and hot hours in kitchens, I changed tack to study for a degree in Management from Birkbeck College (University of London) and then found my way into becoming a Digital Project Manager through the world of Promotional Marketing back in 2010.</p>
                <p>Since that time, I’ve worked on a wide variety of projects - some for a selection of the world’s biggest FMCG brands with 7-figure budgets, some for local SMEs with 4-figure budgets.</p>
                <br>

                        <h5>2010 - Junior Project Manager at Hive</h5>
                        <p>This role was a great education for me. There was no shortage of hands-on experience and exposure to the expectation to deliver on the business needs of the clients that I was working with. It taught me a lot about working with major FMCG brand owners, promotional marketing in a digital context and the importance of managing work to very strict deadlines.</p>

                        <h5>2012 - Project Manager at Hive</h5>
                        <p>After my first couple of years in project management, with some guided experience behind me, I was given the opportunity for some funded training - I became Prince2 certified, took an AgilePM course and undertook some digital technology training. This training, as I took on more responsibility for projects and worked on larger projects with clients like Mondelez and News UK, really accelerated my personal development as a Project Manager.</p>

                        <h5>2016 - Head of Project Management at Hive</h5>
                        <p>Having successfully managed a wide variety of projects over a number of years and worked with some of the UK's biggest brand owners, I moved on to lead a team of Project Managers. This role meant taking overall responsibility for project delivery, setting and managing processes and practices for the delivery teams.</p>

                        <h5>2017 - Digital Project Manager at Impression</h5>
                        <p>In 2017 I made a move out of the FMCG Promotional Marketing corner of the industry and worked with a much broader set of clients on a much more varied set of projects. This was a very valuable change that brought another step-change in my own learning and development, taking all of my experience prior to that point and putting into a wider context whilst picking up a wealth more knowledge in the process.</p>

                        <p>In 2019 I started working in a role on a freelance basis managing the web development for an exciting brand in the automotive sales sector, going much deeper into the business needs and goals as well as technology now being in a client-side role after many years working agency-side across many client projects.</p>
