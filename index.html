    <!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>I'm a freelance digital professional based just outside Leicester, UK.</p>
        <p>I have over 10 years of commercial experience in web projects across a range of industries and specialisms whilst working as a digital project manager. In that time I’ve seen the things that do and don’t work at every stage of delivering web projects and I know what's important for success online.</p>
        <p>More recently, I've retrained from project manager to web developer. I started this process over several years of becoming a better project manager by learning the practical details of web development. The more I learned, the more I loved it and the more I wanted to learn - so it became a full-time commitment - but I haven't left behind all of the knowledge and experience I've gained along the way.</p>

        <h3>Digital strategy</h3>
        <p>Setting the best strategy for your digital activity can feel like a minefield. Fear not! Upwards of 10 years has had me work on this with hundreds of businesses across branding, digital marketing, promotions, social media and more.</p>

        <h3>Web design & development</h3>
        <p>There are so many options for website design and development that it's little wonder people struggle to know which is best for them. Talk to me about your needs and I can help guide you on what'll work best for you.</p>
        <h3>Search Engine Optimisation</h3>
        <p>If you’re looking to reach an online audience, your visibility with search engines is key and can have a big impact on your business's bottom line.</p>
        <p>There's an almost never-ending list of factors that go into your search engine visibilty and I can help you focus on what will have most impact for you.</p>
        <h3>Project Management</h3>
        <p>For any web project to go well, it needs planning and direction from somebody with a good understanding of what's involved and who has the experience, organisation and leadership skills to go with it...that's me! :-)</p>

    <!-- PROJECTS -->
    <section id="experience">
        <h2>Why work with me?</h2>
        <p>In my 10+ years of working on web projects, I've worked with some of the biggest global brands - such as <a href="https://mcvities.co.uk/">McVitie's</a>, <a href="https://www.andrex.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrex</a> & <a href="https://www.kenco.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenco</a> - as well as many smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMEs</a>.</p>
        <p>There are not many aspects of what a business wants to achieve online that I haven't been involved with in some capacity. This gives me a great perspective to know how to put the areas I specialise in to best use.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure, well let's have a conversation and find out!</p>
